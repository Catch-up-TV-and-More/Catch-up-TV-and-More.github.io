# I. Install Kodi

Go to [https://kodi.tv/download](https://kodi.tv/download) and go down to the *Choose your weapon* section to select your operating system.

Download Kodi and install it on your computer. Launch it for the first time to make the first settings such as the language of the interface. There are a lot of tutorials on the internet explaining how to configure Kodi.

# II. Add the official Catch-Up TV & More repository

The plugin is available by default in the Kodi extension library, however the process of submitting updates to the Kodi team is slow. This delay often causes a considerable gap between the version available on the official repository and the latest version of the plugin available on GitHub.

To allow you to always have the latest available version of Catch-Up TV & More we provide an official repository for the plugin. This repository always contains the latest version of the plugin and allows Kodi to automatically update Catch-Up TV & More without any intervention on your part.

### 1. Add the source to add the official repository

Go to the Kodi settings.

* **URL:** https://catch-up-tv-and-more.github.io/repo/
* **Name:** Catch-Up TV & More source

Select the version of Kodi closest to yours (if you are using Kodi Krypton (17), Leia (18) or Matrix (19) choose the `Krypton_(Kodi_17)` folder).

Finally, you can choose between the `stable` and `beta` distribution channel.

If you choose the `beta` channel, Catch-Up TV & More will be updated automatically each time the plugin code is changed to Github. It means that you will always have the latest version and the latest bug fixes/improvements. However you are also exposed to various bugs and instabilities because the latest improvements of beta versions are not fully tested.

The `stable` channel only contains the major versions of the plugin ensuring you a better stability. However the frequency of updates is less important than the `beta` channel.

> The `stable` channel corresponds to the `master` branch of the GitHub repository while the `beta` channel corresponds to the `dev` branch.

### 3. Install Catch-Up TV & More from the official repository

Wait during dependencies installation and the plugin installation.

You can now access the plugin from the Kodi *Add-ons* menu. The plugin will be updated automatically by Kodi.
